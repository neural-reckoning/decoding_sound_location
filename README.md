# decoding_sound_location
Code for paper [Decoding neural responses to temporal cues for sound localization (Goodman, Benichoux, Brette 2013)](https://elifesciences.org/content/2/e01312).

Note that unfortunately this code is not really runnable because it depends on a lot of data files that haven't been
publicly released and which we don't have permission to release.
